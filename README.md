  A collaborative daily drawing game for Discord.
</p>

**CircleSketch** is a robust Discord bot that hosts a daily drawing game. Players join a persistent circle to receive daily prompts, submit their art directly to the bot, and see a gallery of everyone's work at the end of the day. The bot is designed for 24/7 hosting, featuring streak tracking, admin controls, and a clean, modular codebase.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.10+
  * Git

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CircleSketch.git
cd CircleSketch
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3\. Create Your Prompt List

The bot uses a simple Python list for its drawing prompts. To keep your list private, it is not tracked by Git.

1.  **Copy the example file:**

    ```bash
    cp circle_sketch/prompts.example.py circle_sketch/prompts.py
    ```

2.  **Edit `circle_sketch/prompts.py`** and add your own list of prompts.

    *Example `prompts.py`*:

    ```python
    # This list contains the drawing prompts for the bot.
    PROMPT_LIST = [
        "A happy cat wearing a top hat",
        "A robot chef making pancakes",
        "A majestic dragon flying over a futuristic city",
    ]
    ```

### 4\. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project to store your bot's credentials and configuration.

```env
# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-super-secret-bot-token
GAME_CHANNEL_ID=your-game-channel-id

# Optional: Override default settings
# LOG_FILE=logs/bot.log
# SCHEDULED_GAME_TIME=17:00
```

### 5\. Run the Bot

```bash
python run_bot.py
```
